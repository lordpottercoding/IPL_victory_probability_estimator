# IPL Victory Probability Estimator üèè

## **Overview**
The **IPL Victory Probability Estimator** is a machine-learning-based web application that predicts the probability of a team's victory in an IPL match based on historical data and match conditions. The model analyzes factors such as score, overs, wickets, and venue to provide real-time predictions.

## **Features**
- Predicts win probabilities based on current match status.
- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit.
- Uses machine learning for probabilistic match outcome predictions.
- Processes historical IPL match data for improved accuracy.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data Processing)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Streamlit** (Web Application)
- **Pickle** (Model Serialization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Model Training)

## **Installation & Setup**
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lordpottercoding/IPL_victory_probability_estimator.git
cd IPL_victory_probability_estimator
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Run the Streamlit App**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## **Usage**
1. Select the **batting team, bowling team, and match venue**.
2. Input the **target score, current score, overs completed, and wickets fallen**.
3. Click the **Predict Probabilities** button.
4. The app will display **win probabilities** for both teams.

## **Future Improvements**
- **Enhance Model Accuracy** with more features like player performance, weather, and toss results.
- **Integrate Live Match Data** to provide real-time predictions.
- **Deploy the Application** on Streamlit Cloud, AWS, or Heroku.
